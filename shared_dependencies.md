Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the HTML elements. These elements will have unique id names that will be used by the CSS files for styling. 

2. CSS Styling: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will contain the CSS styles for the HTML elements. They will use the id names of the HTML elements to apply the styles.

3. Tailwind CSS: The "tailwind.css" file is a dependency for the "styles.css" file. It will contain the Tailwind CSS framework styles that will be used in the "styles.css" file.

4. Shared Variables: There might be shared CSS variables in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. These variables can be used to maintain consistency in the design, like colors, font sizes, etc.

5. Linking: The "index.html" file will link to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This is a dependency as the HTML file needs to know the location of these CSS files to apply the styles.

6. Dark Theme: Both CSS files will share a common theme, which is a dark and clean design as per the user's request. This will be a shared dependency as the same color scheme and design principles will be used in both files.

Note: As there is no mention of JavaScript or any other programming language, there are no shared dependencies related to exported variables, data schemas, function names, or message names.
