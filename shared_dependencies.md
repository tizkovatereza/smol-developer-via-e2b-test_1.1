1. Tailwind CSS: All three files will share the Tailwind CSS framework. The "tailwind.config.js" file will contain the configuration for Tailwind, including the custom colors (purple and pink). The "styles.css" file will import the Tailwind CSS styles, and the "index.html" file will use the class names defined by Tailwind CSS.

2. DOM Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the DOM elements. The id names of these elements will be shared with any JavaScript functions that manipulate them. For this project, there might not be any JavaScript, but if there were, the id names would be shared.

3. CSS Classes: The "styles.css" file will define custom CSS classes, which will be used in the "index.html" file. These class names are shared between the two files.

4. HTML Structure: The structure of the HTML in "index.html" will be shared with "styles.css" in the sense that the CSS file will need to know the structure in order to correctly apply styles.

5. Color Scheme: The color scheme (purple and pink) will be shared across all files. It will be defined in "tailwind.config.js", used in "styles.css", and applied in "index.html".

6. Media Queries: If the website is responsive, the breakpoints defined in the media queries in "styles.css" will be shared with "index.html" and potentially "tailwind.config.js" if custom breakpoints are defined.

7. Font Styles: If any custom fonts are used, the font names will be shared across "index.html" and "styles.css". The fonts would be imported in the CSS file and used in the HTML file.
